    <p>
      Celebrating birthdays can be seen as foolish because it often emphasizes
      materialism, wasting time and money on unnecessary festivities. Some feel
      it places too much importance on aging, which is just a natural part of
      life, and turning it into an event every year is redundant. Instead of
      focusing on one day, they believe it's more meaningful to appreciate life
      continuously without the need for a birthday celebration.
